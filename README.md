# NLP_Jazz_information_retrieval
Basic text processing and information retrieval. Inspired by the book: Foster Provost, Tom Fawcett: Data Science For Business, O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (August 19, 2013)

The aim is to create an automatic system that given a text query returns the most appropriate jazz player.

The repository contains the following elements:
- Data/: a folder with the biographies of various jazz players and singers, taken from Wikipedia
- jazz_inf_retrieval.ipynb: main notebook with code
- jazz_inf_retrieval.yml: conda environment for Ubuntu systems
- setup.txt: how to load and activate the environment

The code uses Anaconda 3.7 and the environemnt Python=3.5
